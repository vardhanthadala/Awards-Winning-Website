# Award-Winning Website

## Project Description

This project is an award-winning web application designed to showcase various digital assets and content through a highly interactive, modern user interface. It is built using **React** for the frontend, **GSAP** for animations, and integrates smooth video previews and dynamic elements that enhance the user experience. The website is tailored for gaming or entertainment-related content, game previews, and other media.

## Features

1. **Interactive Video Previews**:
   Users can view and interact with videos that showcase trailers or game highlights. Videos are displayed in a sleek, animated interface where users can click to load and play additional video content.

2. **GSAP Animations**:
   The site uses GSAP for smooth animations, providing a seamless transition between video content and UI elements, including dynamic resizing, scaling effects, and responsive behavior based on user interactions.

3. **Dynamic Button Interaction**:
   A key feature of the site is the interactive "Watch Trailer" button, which triggers video playback and creates visually appealing animations when clicked, engaging users in an immersive experience.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   The site is fully responsive, optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The layout and video playback adjust dynamically to provide an optimal viewing experience regardless of screen size.

5. **Video Content Management**:
   The application is set up to handle various video formats, allowing easy integration of new media files into the platform, ensuring the content remains fresh and engaging.

6. **Customizable UI Components**:
   The site includes reusable components like buttons, video players, and animated previews, making it easy to extend the functionality with additional features or new content.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making it easy to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A powerful animation library for creating complex animations and transitions.
- **Video.js or native HTML5 video**: Used to manage video content and playback.
- **Node.js & Express**: Backend server technology (optional for future backend integration or serving videos via API).
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Database (optional, for storing user interactions, video data, or game-related content).
